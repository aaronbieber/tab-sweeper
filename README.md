# ðŸ§¹ Tab Sweeper

Tab Sweeper is a Chrome extension that "sweeps" all of your tabs into a new
group automatically, clearing the bar so you can start opening even more tabs,
dramatically amplifying your ability to sink into browser debt.

## Installation

Follow the [instructions for loading unpacked extensions][lu] on the Chrome
Developers website.

[lu]: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/

## Usage

There are two ways to use Tab Sweeper.

1. Click its icon; all un-pinned, inactive tabs are swept into a collapsed
   group!
   
2. Use a keyboard shortcut to sweep all but the active tab, or all tabs
   including the active one into a group.
   
## Configuring keyboard shortcuts

Open the `chrome://extensions` page by entering that URL directly, or clicking
the puzzle piece icon in your browser bar, or clicking the "three dots" menu and
selecting "More tools" and "Extensions."

On the Extensions page, click the three line "hamburger" menu in the top left,
and within the resulting drawer, click "Keyboard shortcuts." Find the entry for
"Tab Sweeper" and set your desired shortcuts by clicking the pencil icon next to
each shortcut box.
